# IDKHTML

A blazing fast HTML parser that I don't know what to call (HIGHLY WIP!!!)

## Performance

It seems to be about 2~3 times faster than tl and lol_html 

## TODOs

- Make the parser differentiate between less than signs and opening brackets in script tags
- Clean up and optimize the inner tag parsing code (it is very dirty atm)
- Add benchmark image to README
- Force align buffer 
- Implement on_doctype_tag
- Implement tree parser (non-priority)
